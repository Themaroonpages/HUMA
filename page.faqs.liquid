      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Attars are traditional Indian perfumes made from natural botanical sources like flowers, herbs, spices, and wood. Unlike modern perfumes that use alcohol as a base, attars use a base of sandalwood oil. This makes them alcohol-free, longer-lasting, and more concentrated.</p>
